# Face Recognition Attendance Platform

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **face recognition–based attendance platform** designed with a strong emphasis on **system design, modularity, and real-world engineering practices**.

Instead of treating face recognition as a standalone feature, the system is built as a **platform** where face embedding generation, recognition, and attendance marking are clearly separated and extensible.

The project is developed **in phases**, starting with a clean core system and later evolving into a scalable, asynchronous architecture.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build an embedding-based face recognition system
- Automate attendance marking with database-backed logic
- Maintain clear separation between ML and backend layers
- Design a system that can scale with future requirements
