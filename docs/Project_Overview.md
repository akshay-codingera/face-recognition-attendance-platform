Aim : 

To design a scalable and embedded-ready face recognition attendance system that ensures accurate, automated, and secure attendance management.

Objectives :

To analyze limitations of manual and basic digital attendance systems.

To study the need for backend-integrated and scalable attendance solutions.

To design an attendance system compatible with existing camera infrastructure.

Problem Statement :

Existing attendance systems lack scalability, backend integration, and data integrity, making them unreliable for modern distributed and automated environments.

Background :

Attendance management is a fundamental requirement in educational institutions and organizations, where accurate record-keeping is essential for evaluation and compliance. Traditionally, attendance has been recorded using manual registers, which later evolved into card-based, biometric, and basic face recognition systems. While these systems introduced partial automation, they remain centralized, hardware-dependent, and limited in scope.

Most current face recognition attendance systems utilize existing system or legacy cameras but process all data on a single centralized machine. These systems lack backend integration, real-time monitoring, and distributed processing capabilities. As a result, attendance records are difficult to manage, audit, and scale across multiple classrooms or locations. With the growing adoption of smart campuses and digital infrastructure, these limitations highlight the need for a more robust and scalable solution.

Limitations of Existing System

Attendance records are susceptible to proxy marking and inaccurate entries, reducing overall fairness and reliability.

Manual and semi-automated processes introduce increased operational effort and time overhead during attendance recording.

Absence of centralized backend integration results in inefficient data storage, retrieval, and long-term record management.

Poorly structured attendance systems are vulnerable to data manipulation, loss, and corruption, affecting record integrity.

Centralized and monolithic system designs suffer from limited scalability, lack of fault tolerance, and performance bottlenecks.

Proposed Solution : 

The proposed solution is a scalable, backend-integrated, and embedded-ready face recognition attendance system that uses facial embeddings, distributed processing, and centralized data management to ensure accurate, secure, and reliable attendance recording while remaining compatible with existing camera infrastructure.
